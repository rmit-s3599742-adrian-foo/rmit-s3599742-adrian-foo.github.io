							<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
							<p>My interest in it started when I first used a computer in my home. I was only 10 years old when I got to use it and the experience interacting with my first computer sparked my interest instantly. It was my curiosity in the technology that sparked my interest as I said and that made me purse to know everything that made the computer worked. Specifically hardware. So that’s how my curiosity in IT begin.</p>
							<p>My area of interest currently in IT are around A.I and automation how the computer can start and end flows of work when given instruction and the fact when it comes to A.I. How it could make decision on it’s own excites me about the possibilities and its application.</p>
							<p>My current experience in IT are programming languages like Python, Web programming and Java. Additionally some experience working with hardware from building up a PC from scratch.</p>
							<h2>Why did I choose RMIT?</h2>
							<p>I chose RMIT because it was the closest to where I live which is in the city of Melbourne, and I like the guidance and impression the teacher gave to me when I came to open day when I was planning for my university degree. The guidance and helpfulness of the teacher really helped me in that instance make an important decision, therefore, I decided I want to study IT at RMIT university on the same day.</p>
							<h2>what do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
							<p>I expect to learn during my studies these 3 areas. Firstly, to learn the latest technology being used in the industry. Secondly, the skills to operate as an IT professional . Lastly, it’s the market demand for IT technology and it’s application of IT in different industries.</p>

							<h2>Adrian's profile</h2>
							<h3>Myer Briggs Test</h3> <h4>E.S.F.P aka Entertainer</h4>
							<p>The myer briggs test result identify me as a E.S.F.P which shows I am an entertainer personality that means I am outgoing. While generally my character bring spontaneous, wit, enthusiasm and fun to the day to day work.
							My personality as an entertainer I think my prescence may influence the team in this various situation. When it comes to working with others. Entertainers work well with make friends and keep tension at bay within their team. The entertainer may be good at bring enthusiasm and wit to the team by combining energy and fun into the day to day work that needs to be done. Summary, entertainer brings fun, organisation, enthusiasm and leadership as they are good with observing people’s behaviour and influence the team as a result of their prescence.
							When taking into account forming a team, an entertainer like myself can work well with most people and they function best when dealing with non analytical process so there may need to be people in the team who could take those roles up and free the entertainer from and do what they do best which is being creative, and experimenting new ideas.
							</p>
							<h3>Online Learning Style test</h3> <h4>Auditory Learning Style</h4>
							<p>The result show I am an auditory learning style which means I learn best through audio or voice as the main medium I absorb information best. 
							For an auditory learner in a team, I learn best from spoken words where team member usually like to discuss and contribute ideas through meetings where voice can heard or recorded for retention. Also as an auditory learner it is common to have themselves heard in the meeting as its a common way for them to discuss or explain a point. 
							The team formation mean they prefer to usually learn and surround themselves with people who are like themselves who uses methods like discussion, brainstorming, speaking out and meetings to learn and discuss team tasks.
							</p>
							
							<h3>Third Test,Emotional Intelligence Quiz</h3>
							<p>For the emotional intelligence quiz, I did. 
							The result of my emotional intelligence score was quite high, comparable but also the test separated different quadrants from self awareness, self management, social awareness and relationship management.
							Despite I have strong social and self awareness I have areas like that I could improve like self management and relationship managment.Why this is important because it measures your effectiveness with your emotional self, social surroundings and regulating own emotional with those around you.</p>
							The result means I have to be cautious with maintaining impulses and disruptive emotion in a team environment. Where my emotion can clearly affect others behaviour and interrupt team focus on the tasks on hand. Also, I have to build upon my ability to be a goodl character in the team as a leader that can positively impact others to follow or guide them in a team.
							When come to forming a team, I have to know what skills I am bringing on the table and what everyone’s else can bring to the team. Use this to navigate our strengths and weakness to prevent politics and provide forward momentum through effective team work and leadership.</p>

							<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
							<h3>Business Owner, director of a company</h3>
							<p>I always liked the idea of being in control of my own time, income and responsibilities which made me drawn the role of being a business owner.The characteristics to me personally make the role so appealing to being a business owner are the following three.</p>
							<li>One,let start with the the day and hours that I work, I could structure my own working hours to be 30 hours a week, 60 hours a week or 100 hours a week that I am willing to invest into the business.</li>
							<li>Second, the responsibilities I have may be more than some jobs or roles but I can always delegate and creates leverage than having myself work on everything that needs to be done and not doing every task on my own. To me this an important reason why I choose this role as I can use other people’s time to do certain tasks and save me time to do other important things.</li>
							<li>Lastly, the income its not limited to any salary someone set and it’s never dictated by the amount other believe I am worth like a boss or manager.</li>	
							<h3>Skills required as an owner</h3>
							<h4>Six skills are involved</h4> 
							<li>Strategic thinking</li>
							<li>Problem solver</li>
							<li>Leadership</li>
							<li>Communication</li>
							<li>Financial literate</li>
							<li>Execution (general explaination,starting what you want to do, and finishing what you started)</li>
							<h3>What skills I currently have</h3>
							<p>Among the six skills I listed above, I have build up these areas from strategic thinking, problem solver, leadership and communication through my previous experience working in the industry and extracurricular activity.</p>
							<p>The other two skills which include finance literate and execution, I feel are not as strong as the other four.</p>
							<li>Where I am proactively building upon my financial literate from preparing my own financial statements to attending finance and accounting elective class in RMIT university.</li> 
							<li>Additionally execution skill I am practicising the skill like its a muscle by finishing what I started from passion projects to my business ventures.</li>
